{-
  (a) Print a paragraph about the item and mark it as mentioned — this is good for interesting items deserving a paragraph of their own.
  (b) Print a paragraph, but do not mark it as mentioned — this is only likely to be useful if we want to print information related to the item without mentioning the thing itself. (For instance, if the presence of a mysterious parcel resulted in a ticking noise, we could print a paragraph about the ticking noise without mentioning the parcel, which would then appear later.)
  (c) Mark the item as mentioned but print nothing — this gets rid of the item, ensuring that it will not appear in the final "you can also see" sentence, and will not be considered by subsequent rules.
  (d) Do nothing at all — the item then becomes "nondescript" and appears in the final "you can also see" sentence, unless somebody else mentions it in the mean time.
