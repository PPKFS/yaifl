# Structure of the book

It's not quite one module per page, but it's close. The aim is to start with the foundations of the library (basic types and building blocks) and then develops the object model followed by the properties (things that make it interesting) and then actions and rulebooks (making the simulation do things). Finally, there is an overview of all the tests.
