The Plain of the Skull

A vast and trackless plain, enlivened only by the bones of those who have previously tried and failed to cross. Above you is the Endless Tower, which rises half-way to the moon.

The Plain of the Skull

You climb... and climb... and climb... The sun sets. The moon rises. The wind begins to blow. You continue to climb...

Endless Tower

From up here the Plain of the Skull seems only a small bald patch: the world is round and most of it is covered with trees. Far off to the southwest is a shimmering surface that might be water; but there are no signs of cities or civilizations, only the lizard-skeletons.
