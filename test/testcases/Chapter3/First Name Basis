The Crew Lounge
Deliberately spartan: the crew feels weight restrictions here first, so there aren't any chairs, just a few thin pads on the ground.

The one major source of entertainment is the holographic projector, a top of the line Misthon 9000, on which you view every beam you can get.

You can also see Lewis and Harper here.

>x holo

The air above the projector is disappointingly clear.

>x man

Which did you mean: Lewis or Harper?

>lewis

A wiry, excitable engineer who just signed aboard last week.

>x guy

Which did you mean: Lewis or Harper?

>harper

Harper's a good guy: taciturn when sober, affectionate when drunk, but rarely annoying in either state.

>turn on projector

You switch the holographic projector on.

>x holo projector

The projector is now playing a documentary about the early politics of the Mars colony.

>get men

(taking Lewis) I don't suppose Lewis would care for that.

(taking Harper) I don't suppose Harper would care for that.
