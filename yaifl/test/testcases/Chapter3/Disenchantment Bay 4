The Cabin
The front of the small cabin is entirely occupied with navigational instruments, a radar display, and radios for calling back to shore. Along each side runs a bench with faded blue vinyl cushions, which can be lifted to reveal the storage space underneath. A glass case against the wall contains several fishing rods.

Scratched windows offer a view of the surrounding bay, and there is a door south to the deck. A sign taped to one wall announces the menu of tours offered by the Yakutat Charter Boat Company.

>examine sign

You can get half-day and full-day sight-seeing tours, and half-day and full-day fishing trips.

>examine glacier

The Malaspina glacier covers much of the nearby slope, and -- beyond it -- an area as large as Rhode Island.

>examine instruments

Knowing what they do is the Captain's job.

>examine windows

They're a bit the worse for wear, but you can still get an impressive view of the glacier through them. There were whales earlier, but they're gone now.

>examine radar

Apparently necessary to avoid the larger icebergs.

>examine radios

With any luck you will not need to radio for help, but it is reassuring that these things are here.

>take the cushions

They're hardly portable.

>take the glacier

That's hardly portable.
